 I cleaned the data and manipulated it. All the nans were replaced with zero, the columns that I am interested in is ccsmort30rate which shows the rate of incidence of 30 day mortality which is relevant to my research question and also the column mont which will help me identify the realtionship between month of the surgery and it's effect on the mortality of patients after 30 days of the surgery.The column complications is also important since it tells us about the worse outcomes of the surgery,if not death. I will also be analysing gender and age since they are relevant to my hypotheis as confounding variables.
